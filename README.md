# Datomic-ish

A Clojure experiment to simulate datomic over PostgreSQL

## Usage

Create a datom-like structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE txt_datoms(
  id UUID,
  attribute VARCHAR,
  value VARCHAR,
  retract boolean,
  txed_at tstzrange,
  valid_at tstzrange
);

CREATE INDEX ON txt_datoms(valid_at);
CREATE INDEX ON txt_datoms  USING HASH (attribute);
CREATE INDEX ON txt_datoms(value) ;
CREATE INDEX ON txt_datoms(id);
```

Profit
